# `sw`
I don't actually know how go works, so uh... you've been warned. Expect jank.

## Usage

After installing, either put your PK token (which you can get with `pk;token` in Discord) in `$HOME/.pktoken`, use the flag `--token`, or set the environment variable `$PKTOKEN`.

Calling `sw` with no arguments, or with the argument `current`, will show the current list of fronters.  
To switch out, use `sw out`; to switch one or more people in, use their name or 5-letter ID.
